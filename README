term-ws:

	Terminal emulator using websocket and selectel pyte library rewritten in JS

	Installation:
	
		- Install go at http://golang.org/
		- Make binary "term-ws" by running
		    go get -u github.com/YuriyNasretdinov/WebTerm/term-ws
		- Change port and password if you want in shell-ws.php
		- You can also customize bashrc if you want
		- Create writable (empty) "ws.log" in "term-ws/" directory,
		  otherwise daemon will be unable to start
	
	Usage:
		
		- Point your web browser to shell-ws.php and have fun!
		  (any browser with websocket support should work)
		- If you have problems, you probably would need to compile
		  "pt" utility as well. See build instructions in pt.c header
